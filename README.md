# TinyImportParser

## What is it?

This is a small project that I did for fun that parses PE files and prints out the imported DLLs and their respective functions for x86/x64 compiled executables.

## How to use it?

Simply pass in the path to your PE image as a command line argument.

```batch
TinyImportParser.exe <file>
```

## Future Updates

I might update this to implement API sets parsing.
